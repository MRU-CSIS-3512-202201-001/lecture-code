<?php
// ðŸ’¡ Our first iteration. This is useful to do: get something working
//    with hardcoded values. You can then style it the way you want, 
//    figure out the structure of the markup you need and all that fun stuff.
//
//    We're not even worried about PHP at this point!
//
// ðŸ’¡ By the way...Cloudinary is freaking awesome!    
//
// ðŸ’¡ This act of prototyping is very useful - I would actually say necessary - 
//    because we now have something we can improve and, while improving, 
//    make sure things are still working. 
//
// ðŸ§  What do we call the act of taking something that is working and improving it?
